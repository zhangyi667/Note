关于约束：14，15题

参照完整性（Referential Integrity）:当增加、修改或删除数据库表中记录时，可以借助参照完整性来保证相关联表之间数据的一致性 。所以一般如果说要满足参照完整性，一般都涉及两个表（或以上），操作上都是add foreign key. 关于on update 和 on delete 操作都有什么，有什么区别，可以看这里:

ON UPDATE RESTRICT : the default : if you try to update a company_id in table COMPANY the engine will reject the operation if one USER at least links on this company.
ON UPDATE NO ACTION : same as RESTRICT.
ON UPDATE CASCADE : the best one usually : if you update a company_id in a row of table COMPANY the engine will update it accordingly on all USER rows referencing this COMPANY (but no triggers activated on USER table, warning). The engine will track the changes for you, it's good.
ON UPDATE SET NULL : if you update a company_id in a row of table COMPANY the engine will set related USERs company_id to NULL (should be available in USER company_id field). I cannot see any interesting thing to do with that on an update, but I may be wrong.

ON DELETE RESTRICT : the default : if you try to delete a company_id Id in table COMPANY the engine will reject the operation if one USER at least links on this company, can save your life.
ON DELETE NO ACTION : same as RESTRICT
ON DELETE CASCADE : dangerous : if you delete a company row in table COMPANY the engine will delete as well the related USERs. This is dangerous but can be used to make automatic cleanups on secondary tables (so it can be something you want, but quite certainly not for a COMPANY<->USER example)
ON DELETE SET NULL : handful : if you delete a COMPANY row the related USERs will automatically have the relationship to NULL. If Null is your value for users with no company this can be a good behavior, for example maybe you need to keep the users in your application, as authors of some content, but removing the company is not a problem for you.

总结： on update cascade： 当一个表的数据更改后，会帮你同步另一个表的数据。 on update restrict： 当一个表的数据更改的时候,阻止修改. delete 同理.

几种约束的特点:
实体完整性，确保不出现完全相同的数据记录
区域完整性， 通过限制数据类型，检查约束，输入格式，外键约束，默认值，非空等体现
参考完整性，避免因一个数据表的记录改变而造成相关数据表内的数据变成无效值。
用户自定义完整性，用户自定义由用户根据实际应用中的需要自行定义。

从题目中来看name是PK，set not null 可以保证table entity 没有重复值NULL，侧面保证了entity integration




关于怎样判断范式:

范式的tips：
任何数据库都是1NF
只要PK是n个attr，就不是2NF
只要有传递依赖，就不是3NF

error:
An Error is a subclass of Throwable that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch. Most such errors are abnormal conditions. The ThreadDeath error, though a "normal" condition, is also a subclass of Error because most applications should not try to catch it.
A method is not required to declare in its throws clause any subclasses of Error that might be thrown during the execution of the method but not caught, since these errors are abnormal conditions that should never occur. That is, Error and its subclasses are regarded as unchecked exceptions for the purposes of compile-time checking of exceptions.
